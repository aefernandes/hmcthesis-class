\section{Introduction}%
\label{sec:introduction}

For many years I have been fascinated by Pythagorean Triplets
and consequently I have decided to generalize them. 

\section{Proposed Research}%
\label{sec:prop-research}

I will look for numbers $w$, $x$, $y$ and $z$ that satisfy the
condition,
$$w^2+x^2+y^2 =z^2 .$$
My thesis will consist of a complete list of all quadruplets.


\section{Prior Research}%
\label{sec:prior-research}

This subject was first studied by Warthog~\cite{warthog} and more
recently considered by Antelope, Melon and Honeydew~\cite{antelope}.

Finally, I learned how to cite webpages from Walker and
Taylor~\cite{spider}.
